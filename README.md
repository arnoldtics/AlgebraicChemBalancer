# AlgebraicChemBalancer
A Python script that automates the process of balancing a chemical equation with linear algebra. In addition to creating a class to handle the chemical equation.

## Project Information
This project was developed for the subject of linear algebra. However, I also had the opportunity to apply only a fraction of my knowledge in object-oriented programming.

The original paper for this project was written in Spanish, and I have prepared versions of the program in both Spanish and English. The Spanish version aims to provide accessibility to Spanish-speaking users, while the English version caters to a broader audience. Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions or collaboration opportunities.
